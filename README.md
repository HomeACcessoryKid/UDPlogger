# UDPlogger
a light way to get the logs out of your ESP8266

There is a client you can compile on macOS that will collect your logs.
The key advantage is that it is simple, and it only sends outs logs if your client is looking for them.
You can run multiple clients in parallel, each looking for a particular IP address source.
